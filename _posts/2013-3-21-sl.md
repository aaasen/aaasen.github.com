What happens when you misspell `ls`? It's really quite boring.

```bash
$ sl
zsh: command not found: sl
```

A little joke program called `sl` makes this a lot more interesting. This is about what it looks like:

```bash
$ sl
```

<div id="sl">
	<pre>
		<code>

		</code>
	</pre>
</div>
    
## Pranks

Of course, you can use `sl` to do some very devious things. The following code changes the default behaviour of `ls` from listing files to **turning your terminal into an unstoppable steam locomotive**.

```bash
echo "alias ls=\"while true; do sl; done\"" >> .bashrc
```

The only way to end it is closing the terminal, so use this with caution.

**Bonus points:** Make sure to alias all of their text editors to `sl` as well. There will be no escape from the steam locomotive apocalypse.

## I Love Linux

It's little things like this that make me love Linux.
A [joke command from the 90's](http://www.tkl.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~toyoda/index_e.html) has been maintained on almost every distro for about 15 years by awesome people from the community *just for fun*.

That's cool.

## Installation

**Arch Linux:** It's in the AUR under `sl` right [here](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/sl/). How has this not made it in to the main repos yet?

**Everyone Else:** It's in the main repos under `sl` for Debian, Fedora, Ubuntu and probably the others.

Thanks for reading!
