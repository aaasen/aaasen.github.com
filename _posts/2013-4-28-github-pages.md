Github Pages offers unlimitied free hosting of static content for free.

## Free

## Epic Scale

If you take down Github Pages, then damn. That's a lot of traffic.

## Online Editor

GitHub has a great online editor with Markdown previews, Zen mode, etc.

## Git

It's all based on git, so you can revise posts and layouts with no fear.

### Pull Requests

Error in your post? Someone could make a pull request about it! So cool!

## Jekyll

Jekyll is a blog-aware static site generator, and it's what GitHub uses for Pages.
